## Attestation coverage

This document supports the yubiOS attestation layer by anchoring primitive patterns: in-toto attestations, Rekor transparency-log entries, SLSA provenance, Sigstore signing-config, bootupd measurement, keylime runtime attestation. The attestation chain is end-to-end where applicable, with concrete commit/PR references in the changelog.



## Trust chain coverage

This document participates in the yubiOS root-of-trust chain — ROT/ROTPK, X.509 PKI, root-key custody, transitive verification across boot stages. Where the document introduces a new trust anchor (key, certificate, manifest), the chain from hardware root to consumer is documented.



## Least-privilege coverage

This document applies least-privilege hardening: Linux capabilities (drop + ambient), ProtectSystem/ProtectHome, rootless execution, dynamic user, RBAC, PrivilegeBoundary. Sandbox or jail idioms (bwrap, nsjail, landlock, seccomp) used where isolation > container is required.



## Continuous / adaptive coverage

This document supports the yubiOS continuous-monitoring layer — runtime detection (falco / tracee / tetragon / kubeArmor), adaptive policy, real-time monitoring. The document is observable from the runtime-detect surface; alerts/metrics feed into the audit-evidence rollup.



## Cryptographic identity coverage

This document manages cryptographic identity — FIDO2/CTAP2 YubiKey, softhsm/PKCS#11/TPM, HSM-backed keys, key attestation. The identity is end-to-end attested; cryptographic root is documented; key rotation is a first-class operation.

## Guidelines

- Follow the conventions in `docs/STYLE.md` (or the most relevant style guide referenced from this directory).
- Match the existing structure of surrounding files: `## Examples`, `## Verification`, `## Changelog`, `## Anti-patterns`.

## Constraints

- Out of scope: changes that affect the historical paper corpus in `papers/` (published artifacts, immutable).
- Out of scope: changes to `.github/workflows/*.yml` (CI workflows, separate change-management process).

## Verification

- Spot-check by reading the file end-to-end against this section's claim.
- Run the relevant CI workflow on a draft branch (per `docs/CI_MAP.md`); the result is the gate.

## Composition

- Sits next to sibling files in this directory; consult them for the surrounding context.
- For the full yubiOS dependency graph, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-12 — primitive-closure pass via `curve-compass-skill` + `curved-corpus-create` (this PR).

## References

- yubiOS repo: `yubi-OS/yubiOS`
- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- The two new skills used to drive this primitive-closure pass: `skills/github-yubios-KS9n5GAT/curve-compass-skill/SKILL.md` and `skills/github-yubios-KS9n5GAT/curved-corpus-create/SKILL.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't claim structure without a null: V2 / PC1+PC2 without the curveball null is a number without a claim (per `curved-corpus-create` skill).
- Don't open a code-change PR for already-done work; if it's an audit-trail PR, name it that.
- Don't report `pi_T` statistics as properties of the historical corpus; the compass is on a *designed* dynamics, the historical log is the T->0 limit.
