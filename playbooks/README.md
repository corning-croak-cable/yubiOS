# yubiOS Operational Playbooks

Operator-view runbooks, one per recurring failure mode. Format proven by
[`refs/debug-with-cli-2026-08-01.md`](../refs/debug-with-cli-2026-08-01.md).

`refs/` = research. `docs/BLOCKERS.md` = current state. `playbooks/` = the next action.

## How to use

1. Match on **failure mode**, not workflow name.
2. Read **Context** first. If it doesn't describe your situation, stop — file a Linear issue instead.
3. Run **Mechanism** verbatim.
4. Check **Verified working**. If its evidence predates the code you're touching, re-verify.

**Covers:** CI/CD failure modes that have fired ≥ 2 times, plus the verify-before-claim doctrine.
**Does not cover:** one-offs (commit messages / Linear comments); SRE/production runbooks (yubiOS is pre-launch); architecture rationale (`docs/ADR.md`); blocker state (`docs/BLOCKERS.md`); the test scripts' own correctness (separate audit, gated on real-board work).

## Format spec

```
# <Title> (<date>)
## Context                     when this applies
## Decision                    the chosen approach
## Mechanism                   copy-pasteable commands
## Verified working (<date>)   the commit / run / PR that proved it
## Cross-references            Linear, commits, PRs, refs/, other playbooks
```

Optional where they earn it: `Alternatives Considered`, `Tradeoffs`, `Operational`.
Filename `lowercase-hyphenated.md`, **no date suffix** (unlike `refs/`) — playbooks are revised in place.

Hard rules: never cite a run ID, SHA, or PR you have not fetched this session. Every playbook must name ≥ 1 commit/run/PR under `Verified working` — if you can't, it's research, put it in `refs/`.

## Relationship to BLOCKERS.md

[`docs/BLOCKERS.md` → **Permanent CI-Evidence Patterns**](../docs/BLOCKERS.md) is the authoritative register of recurring failure modes. Playbooks operationalize its entries; they do not replace them. Worked example: BLOCKERS.md holds the lex-sort doctrine, [drop-in-override-naming](drop-in-override-naming.md) holds the recipe. When a playbook uncovers a new permanent pattern, add it to BLOCKERS.md **and** cross-link both ways in the same PR.

## Maintenance

Jenny adds to `playbooks/` as new failure modes emerge — a mode qualifies once it has fired twice. Agents draft; **Jenny merges**.

**Not here?** Don't improvise a playbook mid-incident. Fix the incident, then file `playbook: <failure mode>` on team OMNI-AGENT with the run ID and root cause. Known uncovered ground: [`refs/testing-production-gaps-2026-08-01.md`](../refs/testing-production-gaps-2026-08-01.md).
