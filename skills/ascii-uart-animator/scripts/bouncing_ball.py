# ## Purpose
# # Part of yubiOS, a FIDO2-first immutable OS where HSM/U2F is the root of trust
# # for Secure Boot, disk encryption, SSH, and PAM.

# ## Examples
# # python3 this_script.py --help
# # See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for where this fits in yubiOS.

# ## Guidelines
# # Follow the conventions in docs/STYLE.md. Match the structure of surrounding files.

# ## Constraints
# # Out of scope: changes to papers/ or .github/workflows/*.yml (separate change-management).

# ## Verification
# # python3 this_script.py --selftest  # exits 0 iff GREEN, when applicable.
# # See docs/CI_MAP.md for the relevant CI workflow.

# ## Composition
# # Sits next to sibling files in this directory.
# # See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the full dependency graph.

# ## Changelog
# # 2026-08-12 -- primitive-closure pass via curve-compass-skill + curved-corpus-create (this PR).

# ## References
# # yubiOS repo: yubi-OS/yubiOS
# # See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and the two new skills in skills/github-yubios-KS9n5GAT/.

# ## Anti-patterns
# # Don't claim structure without a null (see curved-corpus-create skill).
# # Don't report pi_T statistics as properties of the historical corpus.
