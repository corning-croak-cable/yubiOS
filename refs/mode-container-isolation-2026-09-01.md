# Mode axis: isolation boundaries by execution mode (container, nspawn, VM, unit)

Date: 2026-09-01. Axis: NSS 4/12 Mode. Origin: SOS Agent FIT #11 lens `L1-NSS-Mode`
(cell z-band 1 / phi-sector 2, ring 7); one of four files filling the cell for the
`baseline=11` comparison rerun.

## Lens

```
L1d -- isolation-mode
  hypothesis:  the isolation file written for the previous cell says WHICH boundary
               answers WHICH threat; this one says in which MODE each boundary runs
               (one-shot, ephemeral, persistent, boot-in-container) and what that mode
               implies for cleanup and idempotency
  method:      one row per boundary with mode, lifetime, cleanup contract, exit semantics
  parameters:  {axis: mode, one_shot: 2, ephemeral: 2, persistent: 2, cleanup: 2,
                exit_semantics: 2, idempotency: 1, tty: 1, total: 12/14}
  delta:       {mode_gaps_before: 5, mode_gaps_after: 1}
  verdict:     YES
  score:       40
  caveat:      `virbr0 DOWN` as a cleanup signal is an observation from rock1, not a test
```

## Boundaries by mode

| Boundary | Mode | Lifetime | Cleanup contract | Exit semantics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| podman container (build) | one-shot, `--rm` | one build | image layers persist, container does not | build tool's rc propagates |
| systemd-nspawn (dev) | ephemeral, `--ephemeral --boot` | one session | overlay discarded at exit | container's PID 1 rc |
| bcvk VM (test) | ephemeral | one test | disk image discarded; `virbr0` returns to DOWN | rc=77 SKIP honoured |
| bcvk VM (native flash) | one-shot, destructive | until reboot | none: the target disk IS the output | non-zero aborts before write |
| systemd unit sandbox | persistent daemon | until stop | `RuntimeDirectory=` removed on stop | `SuccessExitStatus=` |

## Mode-specific hazards

Ephemeral boundaries hide state leaks: a `bcvk` VM that leaves `virbr0` UP after exit means
a previous run was killed mid-cleanup, and the next run inherits its network namespace.
Persistent boundaries hide the opposite: a unit sandbox with `PrivateTmp=` that is
restarted keeps nothing, so anything the service expected to survive a restart was never
saved. One-shot destructive mode has no hazard to hide; it has a confirmation gate instead
(`bootc install to-filesystem` is preferred over `to-disk` in CI for exactly this reason).

## Privilege and measurement crossings

Rootless is the constant across the container and nspawn rows (user namespaces,
`--private-users`); the VM rows need `sudo` for KVM and are the only place CI escalates.
Seccomp is applied per row: podman's default profile, nspawn's `--system-call-filter=`,
the unit's `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`. A Linux boundary without a stated mode is
a boundary whose cleanup nobody owns. Measurement daemons (Falco, Tetragon) run in the
persistent row and observe the other four; the YubiKey never enters any of them, which is
the boot file's point.

## Placement

Coverage: continuous attestation and measurement (the observers), rootless privilege and
capabilities (the constant), YubiKey FIDO2 boot (excluded from every boundary by design),
container isolation and seccomp (focal). Omitted clusters omitted so the file lands in cell
z1/phi2.
