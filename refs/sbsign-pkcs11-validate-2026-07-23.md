_Refreshed: 2026-07-23 (renamed from refs/sbsign-pkcs11-validate.md, no date suffix previously)_

Cross-checked 2026-07-23 against refs/mkosi-bcvk-fork-status-2026-07-23.md: mkosi upstream (v27) confirms native support for `SecureBootKeySource=engine:pkcs11` / `provider:pkcs11` via `systemd-sbsign`, matching this file's validation shape exactly. No drift found — yubiOS's implementation is aligned with current upstream mkosi capability.

# systemd-sbsign PKCS#11 validation

Status: validation path documented and wired for the yubiOS signing flow. A physical YubiKey remains required for final production signing validation.

## Goal

Validate `systemd-sbsign` with YubiKey PIV slot 9c through PKCS#11, then verify the signed UKI with `osslsigncode`.

## Manual validation shape

```sh
p11-kit list-modules | grep ykcs11
systemd-sbsign sign \
  --private-key "pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%9c;type=private" \
  --private-key-source engine:pkcs11 \
  --certificate /etc/yubico/sb-cert.pem \
  --output yubiOS.signed.efi \
  yubiOS.efi
osslsigncode verify -in yubiOS.signed.efi -CAfile /etc/yubico/sb-cert.pem
```

## Repo hook

Run `tests/validate-pkcs11-uri.sh` after `yubiOS-enroll-sb` on a host with a configured YubiKey. The signing step is the primary gate; `osslsigncode` corroborates the PE signature.

## Consistency rule

Keep build docs on `systemd-sbsign`; do not reintroduce legacy `sbsign --engine pkcs11` examples except as historical context in ADR-008.
