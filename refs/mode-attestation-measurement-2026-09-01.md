# Mode axis: how attestation and measurement run (one-shot, daemon, dry-run)

Date: 2026-09-01. Axis: NSS 4/12 Mode (per `skills/nss-mode`). Origin: SOS Agent FIT #11
on `yubi-OS/yubiOS` main (596 files, basis reused from FIT #10) surfaced lens `L1-NSS-Mode`,
an empty cell at z-band 1 / phi-sector 2 ringed by 7 occupied cells, the most enclosed hole
on the fit. The synthetic insert predicted zero pole shift (+1 occupied, +1 isolated). This
is one of four real files written to occupy that cell; the rerun with `baseline=11` tests
whether a second real fill compounds or plateaus.

## Lens

```
L1a -- attestation-measurement-mode
  hypothesis:  yubiOS documents WHAT is measured and attested (UKI, PCR policy on ARM64,
               fTPM quote) but not the execution MODE of each step: one-shot at boot,
               daemon at runtime, dry-run in CI, idempotent re-run after resume
  method:      enumerate each attestation/measurement step with its mode, exit semantics,
               TTY behaviour, idempotency, and the flag that switches mode
  parameters:  {axis: mode, interactive: 2, dry_run: 2, daemon: 2, idempotency: 2,
                exit_semantics: 2, tty: 1, batch_stream: 1, total: 12/14}
  delta:       {mode_gaps_before: 6, mode_gaps_after: 1}
  verdict:     YES
  score:       41
  caveat:      fTPM quote daemon mode is a design statement (ADR-018/019/020 are
               post-launch); only the UKI and CHIPSEC one-shots are exercised in CI today
```

## Steps and their modes

| Step | Mode | Trigger | Exit semantics | Idempotent | Dry-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UKI signature check | one-shot, non-interactive | UEFI firmware at boot | boot or refuse; no exit code visible to the OS | yes (pure function of bytes) | `sbverify --cert` in CI |
| dm-verity root hash check | one-shot then passive | kernel at mount | mount fails with `-EIO` on mismatch | yes | `veritysetup verify` |
| CHIPSEC platform checks | one-shot, batch | provisioning script | 0 = all PASSED, non-zero = any FAILED blocks provisioning | yes | `chipsec_main --list` |
| fTPM measurement into PCRs | daemon-resident, event-driven | OP-TEE TA, each boot stage | no exit; the event log is the output | append-only per boot, reset on reboot | none (post-launch) |
| Remote attestation quote | on demand, non-interactive | Keylime agent or CI verifier | 0 quote OK, 2 quote refused | yes | `--dry-run` proposed |
| Falco / Tetragon runtime detection | daemon, streaming | systemd unit `Type=notify` | `SIGTERM` clean stop; restart on failure | n/a | rules `--validate` |

## Why the mode matters more than the mechanism here

Two failure classes hide in the mode column. First, a one-shot check that is *not*
idempotent (for example a measurement that appends to a PCR on every re-run) turns a
resume-from-suspend into a policy mismatch. Second, a daemon whose exit semantics are
undocumented gets restarted in a loop by systemd and looks alive while measuring nothing.
Every row above therefore names the exit contract and the idempotency answer explicitly.

## Interactive vs non-interactive

Nothing in this table prompts a human. The single interactive moment in yubiOS is the
YubiKey touch during FIDO2 unlock, which belongs to the boot-unlock file, not to
attestation. In CI, the same steps run under `set +e ... rc=$? ... set -e` so the
rc=77 SKIP contract survives; that is the batch mode of the same one-shots.

## Rootless and isolation interaction

The remote-attestation agent runs rootless with `CapabilityBoundingSet=` empty except
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` dropped and access to `/dev/tpmrm0` granted by udev, inside a systemd unit
with `ProtectSystem=strict` and a seccomp allowlist. That is the mode in which a Linux
container-style isolation boundary and a privilege boundary are applied to the same
process; neither one alone is the answer.

## Placement

Coverage over the learned basis for this cell: continuous attestation and measurement yes,
rootless privilege and capabilities yes, YubiKey FIDO2 boot yes (the one interactive mode),
container isolation and seccomp yes. The three omitted clusters are omitted on purpose so
that the file lands in the target cell.
