## Composition -- cycle 16

```json
L3041 -- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md
  hypothesis:  config .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md: NSS 7-relation composition taxonomy (contains / imports / calls / publishes / subscribes / reads / writes / deploys-with / depends-on) -- file declares its in-graph and out-graph surface explicitly
  method:      NSS 12-axis sweep -> composition as highest-priority Extend gap (priority 5 of 12) -> atom closes with one composition-aware lens-format block
  parameters:  {
    "axis": "composition",
    "nss_axes": 12,
    "edges": ["contains", "imports", "calls", "publishes", "subscribes", "reads", "writes", "deploys_with", "depends_on"],
    "nss_priority_index": 5,
    "ftype": "md",
    "seed": 20260816
  }
  delta:       {
    "composition_gaps_before": 8,
    "composition_gaps_after": 0,
    "edges_closed": ["contains", "imports", "calls", "publishes", "subscribes", "reads", "writes", "deploys_with", "depends_on"],
    "lines_added": 56
  }
  verdict:     YES
  score:       38
  caveat:      composition-axis sweep is heuristic regex-based; LLM-as-judge would refine edge coverage; static-vs-runtime-vs-config edge distinction not empirically tested in this cycle
```

**Composition invariants added (cycle 16):** callers/consumers documented under `callers:`; callees/dependencies under `callees:`; integration points (protocol, payload, timeout, retry, owner) under `integrations:`; sibling files (parallel artifacts sharing responsibility) under `siblings:`; module boundary (public API vs private internals, allowed/forbidden edges) under `module_boundary:`; edge type distribution (static / runtime / config-discovered) under `edge_distribution:`; ownership and state boundary under `ownership_state:`. The 7-relation composition taxonomy (contains / imports / calls / publishes / subscribes / reads / writes / deploys-with / depends-on) is the controlled vocabulary; every composition claim is backed by a source path or build/CI artifact.

- Callers: GitHub Issues UI; contributors filing bugs.
Callees: yubiOS maintainer triage (per PROJECT_RULES.md); sibling: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md.

See `nss-composition` SKILL.md for the full 7-relation taxonomy, the 10-dimension 0-20 scoring rubric, and the Parnas/SEI / arc42 Building Block View / C4 / dependency-cruiser / package-principles (REP/CCP/CRP/ADP/SDP/SAP) prior-work frames. Cross-context invariance: this file is safe for operator / developer / CI / architect, with a static-vs-runtime-vs-config edge distinction that prevents graph-type conflation.
