## Examples

- Reading `bug_report.md` (no args) shows usage
- See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for where this file fits in yubiOS


## Guidelines

- Match the conventions in `docs/STYLE.md`
- See sibling files in this directory for the surrounding context


## Constraints

- Out of scope: changes to `papers/` (historical info) or `.github/workflows/*.yml` (CI workflows)


## Verification

- Spot-check by reading `bug_report.md` end-to-end against this section's claim
- Run the relevant CI workflow on a draft branch per `docs/CI_MAP.md`


## Composition

- Sits next to sibling files in this directory; consult them for surrounding context
- For the full yubiOS dependency graph, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`


## Changelog

- 2026-08-12 -- RSI cycle-4: new-idea experiment (primitive-flipped changelog, hypothesis + method + delta + verdict + score + caveat in lenses.json L<N>)


## References

- yubiOS repo: `yubi-OS/yubiOS`
- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- See root `lenses.json` and `new-ideas-2026-08-12.md`


## Anti-patterns

- Don't claim structure without a null (per `curved-corpus-create`)
- Don't report pi_T as a property of the historical corpus (per `curve-compass-skill`)
